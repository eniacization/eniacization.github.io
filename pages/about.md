Hi there, among the things I liked to do in the past, am doing at present, and would like to do in the future, are

* programming,
* physics,
* epistemology,
* running.

I want to use this blog to share my thoughts on those and other topics.
I hope this is an opportunity to clear my thoughts and get input from you.

Check out the related [blog by Manuel Wiese](https://manuelwiese.github.io/).
